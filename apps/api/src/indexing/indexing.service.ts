/**
 * IndexingService
 *
 * The main long-running process that pulls on-chain logs via Hypersync and
 * feeds them into our persistence pipeline.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Manage Hypersync client connection and polling loop.
 * - Resume from the last processed block (via EventProcessor.lastBlockNumber()).
 * - Normalize logs into `EventData` and delegate to EventProcessor
 *   (which writes into `indexing_events`, `stakes`, and `stake_changes`).
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 * - start(): begins the indexing loop (no-op if indexing disabled in config).
 * - loop(): pulls batches from Hypersync until stopped; applies backoff (delayMs).
 * - processLog(): wraps a single raw log → `EventData` → EventProcessor.
 * - close(): stops the loop gracefully (abort + await outstanding work).
 *
 * Guarantees:
 * - At-most-once application of chain events is enforced downstream by DB
 *   uniqueness on (tx_hash, log_index).
 * - AbortError is silenced for clean shutdown; all other errors bubble up.
