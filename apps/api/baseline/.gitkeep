# This directory is for baseline migrations
# 
# Place your legacy SQL file here as 'baseline.sql'
# 
# Your baseline.sql should contain:
# - Complete database schema from your legacy state
# - All necessary data that predates Drizzle migrations
# - No DROP statements (the system handles preparation)
# 
# The baseline will be applied automatically before running
# normal Drizzle migrations on fresh databases.
