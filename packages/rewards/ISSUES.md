# Analysis

This document outlines all potential issues with the `@recallnet/rewards` package implementation.

## Issues

### 1. **Mathematical Formula Edge Cases**

- **Issue**: The decay formula `w_i = ((1-r) * r^(i-1)) / (1-r^k)` can have numerical instability
- **Risk**: When `r` approaches 1 or 0, or when `k` is very large, the formula can produce unexpected results
- **Impact**: Could break reward distribution entirely
- **Mitigation**: Add bounds checking and fallback calculations

### 2. **Tie Handling**

- **Issue**: No logic for handling tied competitors
- **Risk**: Undefined behavior when competitors have equal scores
- **Impact**: Unpredictable results
- **Mitigation**: Define tie-breaking rules

### 3. **Reward Distribution Completeness**

- **Issue**: The spec mentions that total payouts may not equal the prize pool due to time decay
- **Risk**: Users might not receive the full prize pool
- **Impact**: User dissatisfaction
- **Mitigation**: Document this behavior clearly and consider redistribution strategies

### 4. **No Audit Trail**

- **Issue**: No logging or verification of calculations
- **Risk**: Difficult to debug or verify results
- **Impact**: Trust and debugging issues
- **Mitigation**: Add comprehensive logging

### 5. **Deterministic but Unverifiable**

- **Issue**: While calculations are deterministic, there's no way to verify them externally
- **Risk**: Users can't independently verify their rewards
- **Impact**: Trust issues
- **Mitigation**: Provide verification tools or APIs

## Performance and Scalability Issues

### 6. **O(nÂ²) Algorithm Complexity**

- **Issue**: The main calculation loops through all users for each competitor
- **Risk**: Performance degrades quadratically with number of users/competitors
- **Impact**: Could become slow with large competitions
- **Mitigation**: Optimize algorithm or add performance monitoring

### 7. **Memory Usage**

- **Issue**: Creates multiple large objects (`competitorTotals`, `userTotals`, `prizePoolSplits`)
- **Risk**: Memory usage grows linearly with number of users and competitors
- **Impact**: Could cause out-of-memory errors in large competitions
- **Mitigation**: Stream processing or memory-efficient data structures

### 8. **Decimal.js Memory Overhead**

- **Issue**: Each calculation creates many `Decimal` objects
- **Risk**: High memory usage and potential garbage collection issues
- **Impact**: Performance degradation
- **Mitigation**: Object pooling or alternative decimal implementation

### 9. **No Performance Tests**

- **Issue**: No tests for large-scale scenarios
- **Risk**: Performance issues discovered only in production
- **Impact**: Production performance problems
- **Mitigation**: Add performance benchmarks

## Low Impact Issues

### 10. **Leap Year and DST Issues**

- **Issue**: `DAY_MS = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000` assumes exactly 24 hours
- **Risk**: During DST transitions, day boundaries might be incorrect
- **Impact**: Minor timing issues
- **Mitigation**: Use proper date libraries or document limitations
