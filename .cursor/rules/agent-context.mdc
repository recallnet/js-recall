# Agent Context Folder

The `.agent/` directory is used for maintaining development context and task tracking:

## Specifications
- Create `spec.md` for new features or major changes
- Ensure specs align with GitHub issues
- Get developer approval on specs before proceeding
- Include acceptance criteria and requirements

## Development Plans
- Create `developer_plan.md` for implementation tracking
- Break down tasks into clear, measurable phases
- Include links to relevant documentation and examples
- Track completion status for each task
- Document dependencies and prerequisites
- Split complex plans into multiple PRs if needed

###  Build and Test Requirements
You can never check off a task unless the following pass all quality checks.

## Task Management
- Use checkboxes to track completed items
- Document blockers and dependencies
- Keep notes on additional work discovered
- Track progress against acceptance criteria

## Pull request
- use .agent/pull_request.md to document a pull request comment for the project.

## Quality Gates
Before marking a phase complete, verify:
- All lint checks pass
- Prettier formatting is correct
- Documentation is complete
- Build succeeds
- Development environment runs
- If editing the README, please conform to the [standard-readme](mdc:https:/github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme) specification.

## Development Tracking
- Ensure all secrets or passwords are ketp out of tracked code. Never commit files such as .env.
- Execute a `git add . && git commit -m "<description of the change>"` after each change you make.
