# Global Leaderboard Performance Optimization

## Summary

Successfully optimized the global leaderboard performance by moving sort and limit operations from in-memory JavaScript to SQL level using Drizzle ORM.

## Changes Made

### 1. Repository Layer (`leaderboard-repository.ts`)

- **Added parameters** to `getOptimizedGlobalAgentMetricsImpl`:
  - `sort?: string` - Sort field with optional '-' prefix for descending
  - `limit?: number` - Number of results to return
  - `offset?: number` - Number of results to skip
- **Implemented SQL-level sorting** for:
  - `rank` (sorts by score)
  - `name` (alphabetical)
  - `score` (numerical)
- **Optimized pagination** - Applied LIMIT and OFFSET at database level when possible
- **Added `getTotalAgentsWithScoresImpl`** - Efficient count query for pagination metadata
- **Special handling** for `competitions` and `votes` sorting which require aggregation (still done in-memory but only for the limited result set)

### 2. Service Layer (`leaderboard.service.ts`)

- **Removed in-memory operations**:
  - Eliminated `.sort()` on entire dataset
  - Eliminated `.slice()` on entire dataset
- **Updated `getOptimizedGlobalMetrics`** to pass sort/pagination params to repository
- **Added `getTotalAgentsCount`** method using the new efficient count query
- **Refactored `assignRanks`** method to handle different sorting scenarios correctly
- **Removed obsolete `sortAgents`** method entirely

### 3. Testing

- Added comprehensive unit tests in `leaderboard-optimization.test.ts`
- Tests verify:
  - Parameters are correctly passed to repository
  - Empty competition handling
  - Rank assignment for different sort fields
- All tests pass successfully

## Performance Benefits

### Before Optimization

1. Fetch ALL agents from database
2. Fetch competition counts for ALL agents
3. Fetch vote counts for ALL agents
4. Sort ALL agents in JavaScript memory
5. Slice to get paginated subset

### After Optimization

1. Fetch ONLY needed agents from database (with SQL ORDER BY and LIMIT)
2. Fetch counts only for the limited result set
3. No in-memory sorting for most cases (rank, name, score)
4. Efficient total count query for pagination metadata

### Expected Improvements

- **Reduced data transfer**: Only fetch the agents needed for current page
- **Lower memory usage**: No need to hold entire dataset in memory
- **Better scalability**: Performance remains constant as dataset grows
- **Database optimization**: Leverages database indexes for sorting

## Code Quality

- ✅ All linting checks pass
- ✅ All formatting checks pass
- ✅ Build succeeds
- ✅ Unit tests pass
- ✅ No migration changes needed (schema unchanged)
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility (service interface unchanged)

## Files Modified

1. `apps/api/src/database/repositories/leaderboard-repository.ts`
2. `apps/api/src/services/leaderboard.service.ts`
3. `apps/api/src/services/__tests__/leaderboard-optimization.test.ts` (new)

## Next Steps

Consider these potential future optimizations:

1. Add database indexes on commonly sorted fields if not already present
2. Implement caching for frequently accessed leaderboards
3. Consider materialized views for complex aggregations if needed
